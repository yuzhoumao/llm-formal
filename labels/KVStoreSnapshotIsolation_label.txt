Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2023-11-02 11:08:28.
Progress(12) at 2023-11-02 11:08:31: 816,954 states generated (816,954 s/min), 123,266 distinct states found (123,266 ds/min), 67,835 states left on queue.
Progress(19) at 2023-11-02 11:09:31: 34,635,174 states generated (33,818,220 s/min), 2,631,750 distinct states found (2,508,484 ds/min), 513,451 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 9.8E-6
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.8E-7
56349379 states generated, 3409605 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 23.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 12 and the 95th percentile is 4).
