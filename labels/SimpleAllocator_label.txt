Implied-temporal checking--satisfiability problem has 10 branches.
Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2023-11-02 10:33:30.
Progress(6) at 2023-11-02 10:33:31: 1,633 states generated, 400 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking 10 branches of temporal properties for the complete state space with 4000 total distinct states at (2023-11-02 10:33:31)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2023-11-02 10:33:31
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.7E-14
1633 states generated, 400 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 6.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 9 and the 95th percentile is 4).
