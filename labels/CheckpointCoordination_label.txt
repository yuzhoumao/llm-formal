Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2023-11-02 09:34:37.
Progress(10) at 2023-11-02 09:34:40: 185,256 states generated (185,256 s/min), 15,574 distinct states found (15,574 ds/min), 8,569 states left on queue.
Progress(19) at 2023-11-02 09:35:41: 14,084,194 states generated (13,898,938 s/min), 650,590 distinct states found (635,016 ds/min), 109,875 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.1E-6
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.1E-7
23112567 states generated, 901692 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 29.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 10 and the 95th percentile is 3).
