Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2023-11-02 09:27:13.
Progress(29) at 2023-11-02 09:27:13: 336 states generated, 67 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 67 total distinct states at (2023-11-02 09:27:13)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2023-11-02 09:27:13
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 9.8E-16
336 states generated, 67 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 29.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 4 and the 95th percentile is 2).
