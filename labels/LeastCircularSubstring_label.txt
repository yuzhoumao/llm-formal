Finished computing initial states: 127 distinct states generated at 2023-11-02 11:28:18.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 5.9E-14
8681 states generated, 8554 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 95.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 1 and the 95th percentile is 1).
