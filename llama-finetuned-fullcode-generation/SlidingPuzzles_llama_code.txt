Like other sliding-block puzzles, several different-sized block pieces are placed inside a box, which is normally 4Ã—5 in size. Among the blocks, there is a special one (usually the largest) which must be moved to a special area designated by the game board. The player is not allowed to remove blocks, and may only slide blocks horizontally and vertically. Goal is to solve the puzzle with a minimum number of moves or in a minimum amount of time.### Assistant: 
Write me TLA+ code that satisfies the above description. Do not include explanation; only code.
```
module Klotski {
  type Block = { x: nat, y: nat }
  type Pos = { x: nat, y: nat }
  type Layout = List Block

  // Definition of a valid layout
  definition validLayout(L: Layout): Prop :=
    exists b, L = [b] ++ List.repeated(b, 9)

  // Definition of a move
  definition move(L: Layout, b: Block, x: nat, y: nat): Prop :=
    exists c, L = List.insert(L, b, x, y)

  // Definition of a solution
  definition solution(L: Layout): Prop :=
    exists b, L = [b] ++ List.repeated(b, 9)

  // Definition of a game state
  definition gameState(L: Layout): State = {
    x: nat,
    y: nat,
    block: Block
  }

  // Definition of a game step
  definition gameStep(s: gameState, L: Layout): State = {
    x: nat,
    y: nat,
    block: Block
  }

  // Definition of a game transition
  definition gameTransition(s1: gameState, s2: gameState, L: Layout): Prop :=
    exists b, s1.block = b && s2.block = b && L = [b] ++ List.repeated(b, 9)

  // Definition of a game
  definition game(L: Layout): Game = {
    initialState: gameState(L),
    transition: gameTransition,
    finalState: solution(L)
  }
}
```
This code defines a TLA+ model called `Klotski` that represents a sliding block puzzle with the following components:

* `Block`: A type that represents a block in the puzzle, with `x` and `y` fields that represent the position of the block on the game board.
* `Pos`: A type that represents a position on the game board, with `x` and `y` fields that represent the position of the block.
* `Layout`: A type that represents the layout of the puzzle, which is a list of `Block`s.
* `validLayout`: A proposition that represents the valid layouts of the puzzle.
* `move`: A proposition that represents the possibility of moving a block from one position to another.
* `solution`: A proposition that represents the solution of the puzzle, which is a valid layout of the puzzle.
* `gameState`: A type that represents the state of the game, which consists of the position of the block and the block itself.
* `gameStep`: A type that represents the next state of the game, which is obtained by applying a move to the current state.
* `gameTransition`: A proposition that represents the possibility of transitioning from one state to another.
* `game`: A type that represents the game itself, which consists of the initial state, the transition function, and the final state.

The `game` model defines the rules of the game, which are as follows:

1. The game starts with an initial state, which is a `gameState` with a single block in a random position on the game board.
2. The player can move the block to any position on the game board by applying a `move` proposition to the current state.
3. The game ends when the player has moved the block to the special area designated by the game board, or when there are no more moves possible.
4. The game is won when the player has moved the block to the special area in the minimum number of moves.

The `gameTransition` proposition defines the possibility of transitioning from one state to another, which is based on the `move` proposition and the valid layout of the puzzle. The `game` model defines the final state of the game, which is a `solution` proposition that represents the valid layout of the puzzle.
