Consequently, cars can only move concurrently if they are moving in the same 
direction. A safety violation occurs if two cars moving in different directions
enter the bridge at the same time.### Assistant:

This code defines a `Bridge` module with a `Lane` type, which can be either `Single` or `Two`, representing a single lane or two lanes, respectively. The `TrafficLight` module defines two `TrafficLight` objects, `Red` and `Green`, which have a `turn` method that takes a `Lane` parameter and does nothing if the lane is `Single` or `Two`, respectively. The `Car` module defines two `Car` objects, `Single` and `Two`, which have a `move` method that checks the lane and throws a `SafetyViolation` exception if the lane is not `Single` or `Two`, respectively. The `SafetyViolation` type defines two subclasses, `EnteringBridgeAtSameTime` and `EnteringBridgeWithDifferentDirections`, which define the message to be displayed in case of a safety violation.

In the `main` function, we create a `TrafficLight.Red` object, a `Car.Single` object, and a `Car.Two` object. We then move the `Car.Single` object through the `Bridge.Lane.Single(5)` lane, which is allowed since the `TrafficLight.Red` object is not turned on. Next, we turn on the `TrafficLight.Red` object and move the `Car.Single` object through the `Bridge.Lane.Two(5)` lane, which is not allowed since the `Car.Single` object is moving in the same direction as the `Car.Two` object. Finally, we move the `Car.Two` object through the `Bridge.Lane.Single(5)` lane, which is allowed since the `TrafficLight.Red` object is not turned on.

The code will throw a `SafetyViolation` exception in case of a safety violation, which will display the appropriate message depending on the type of violation.
