--------------------------- MODULE FastPaxos -----------------------------
(*
    This is a simplified specification of Leslie Lamport's Fast Paxos protocol.
    The following papers, Fast Paxos by Leslie Lamport and Fast Paxos Made Easy: Theory and Implementation by Zhao Wenbing
    was referenced in writing this specification.

    This simplified specification was written by Lim Ngian Xin Terry & Gaurav Gandhi.

    The following assumptions are made in this simplified specification.

    1. There is a unique coordinator in the system. Therefore, Phase 1a and 1b can be omitted.

    2. All agents in the system can communicate with one another.

    3. Agents must have some stable storage that survives failure and restarts.
       An agent restores its state from stable storage when it restarts, so the failure of an agent
       is indistinguishable from its simply pausing. There is thus no need to model failures explicitly.

(*
    A value is chosen if a fast quorum of acceptors proposed that value in a fast round.

    Because the quorum size of a fast round and classic round is different, we assume that the acceptor distinguishes
    a fast round and classic round based on the P2a message it receives. If the P2a message contains the special value
    "any", it is a fast round. Else it is a classic round.

(*
    Phase 2a (Classic)

    If more than one value has been proposed, the collision is resolved using the following rules:

    1. If the proposals contain different values, a value must be selected if the majority of
       acceptors in the fast quorum have casted a vote for that value.

    2. Otherwise, the coordinator is free to select any value.

    Functionally similar to PaxosDecide in Paxos.tla, but we also have to
    ensure that it can only occur in classic rounds and not fast rounds.
