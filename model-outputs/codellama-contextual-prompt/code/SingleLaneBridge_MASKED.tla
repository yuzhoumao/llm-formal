-------------------------- MODULE SingleLaneBridge --------------------------

\* A bridge over a river is only wide enough to permit a single lane of traffic.
\* Consequently, cars can only move concurrently if they are moving in the same 
\* direction. A safety violation occurs if two cars moving in different directions
\* enter the bridge at the same time.
\* To visualize the problem, refer to https://flylib.com/books/en/2.752.1.48/1/
