### Human: Write a TLA+ module named "MC" that extends the "ReadersWriters" module and imports "TLC". Define a constant "n" with a value of 3. Include the following violated invariants:
Cardinality of readers is less than n.
Cardinality of WaitingToWrite is less than n.
If WaitingToRead is non-empty, then WaitingToWrite is empty.
If WaitingToWrite is non-empty, then WaitingToRead is empty.
### Assistant:
```

---- MODULE MC ----

EXTENDS ReadersWriters, TLC

n == 3

\* The following invariants are all violated:
\* - Cardinality(readers) < n
\* - Cardinality(WaitingToWrite) < n
\* - WaitingToRead /= {} => WaitingToWrite = {}
\* - WaitingToWrite /= {} => WaitingToRead = {}
