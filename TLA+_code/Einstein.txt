EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets

\* Note that TLC!Permutations has a Java module override and, thus,
\* would be evaluated faster.  However, TLC!Permutations equals a
\* set of records whereas Permutation below equals a set of tuples/
\* sequences.  Also, Permutation expects Cardinality(S) = 5.
Permutation(S) == 
    { p \in [ 1..5 -> S ] :
        /\ p[2] \in S \ {p[1]}
        /\ p[3] \in S \ {p[1], p[2]}
        /\ p[4] \in S \ {p[1], p[2], p[3]}
        /\ p[5] \in S \ {p[1], p[2], p[3], p[4]} }
                
\* In most specs, the following parameterization would be defined as
\* constants.  Given that Einstein's riddle has only this
\* parameterization, the constants are replaced with constant-level
\* operators.  As a side-effect, TLC evaluates them eagerly at startup, 
\* and Apalache successfully determines their types.
