\* The type invariant; the proof system likes knowing variables are in Nat.
\* It's a good idea to check these invariants with the model checker before
\* trying to prove them. To quote Leslie Lamport, it's very difficult to
\* prove something that isn't true!
TypeOK ==
  /\ f \in Seq(Nat)
  /\ i \in 1..(Len(f) + 1)
  /\ i \in Nat
  /\ h \in Nat \cup {-1}

\* It's useful to prove the type invariant first, so it can be used as an
\* assumption in further proofs to restrict variable values.
THEOREM TypeInvariantHolds == Spec => []TypeOK
\* To prove theorems like Spec => []Invariant, you have to:
\*  1. Prove Invariant holds in the initial state (usually trivial)
\*  2. Prove Invariant holds when variables are unchanged (usually trivial)
\*  3. Prove that assuming Invariant is true, a Next step implies Invariant'
\* The last one (inductive case) is usually quite difficult. It helps to
\* never forget you have an extremely powerful assumption: that Invariant is
\* true!
PROOF
  \* The base case
  <1>a. Init => TypeOK
    BY DEFS Init, TypeOK
  \* The stuttering case
  <1>b. TypeOK /\ UNCHANGED vars => TypeOK'
    BY DEFS TypeOK, vars
  \* The inductive case; usually requires breaking down Next into disjuncts
  <1>c. TypeOK /\ Next => TypeOK'
    <2>a. TypeOK /\ lb => TypeOK'
      BY DEFS TypeOK, lb, max
    <2>b. TypeOK /\ Terminating => TypeOK'

    <2> QED BY <2>a, <2>b DEF Next
  <1> QED BY PTL, <1>a, <1>b, <1>c DEF Spec

\* The inductive invariant; writing these is an art. You want an invariant
\* that can be shown to be true in every state, and if it's true in all
\* states, it can be shown to imply algorithm correctness as a whole.
