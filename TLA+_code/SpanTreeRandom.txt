### Human: Provide specification to solve the problem in TLA+. The specification in this module is a modified version of the one in    *)
(* module SpanTree obtained by replacing the declared constant Edges with  *)
(* a defined constant that equals a randomly chosen set of edges joining   *)
(* the nodes in Nodes.  Thus it can be used to test the algorithm of       *)
(* SpanTree on a randomly chosen node, making it easy to check the         *)
(* algorithm on a sequence of different graphs.
