### Human: Provide algorithm to solve the problem in TLA+. This is an algorithm to compute a spanning tree of an undirected graph  *)
(* with a given root.  Look up "spanning tree" on the Web to see what that *)
(* means.  You may find pages for finding spanning trees of graphs with    *)
(* weighted edges.  The algorithm here effectively assumes each edge has   *)
(* weight 1.                                                               *)

(* A rooted tree is usually described by a set of nodes with a             *)
(* parent/child relation, where the root is the oldest ancestor of all     *)
(* other nodes.  The algorithm computes this relation as a function `mom'  *)
(* where mom[n] equals the parent of node n, except that if n is the root  *)
(* then mom[n] = n.  If the graph is not connected, then the rooted tree   *)
(* does not contain nodes of the graph that have no path to the root.      *)
(* Such nodes n will have mom[n]=n.                                        *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* A simple algorithm to compute the rooted spanning tree computes a       *)
(* function dist where dist[n] is the distance of node n from the root.    *)
(* Initially, dist[n] equals 0 if n is the root and otherwise equals       *)
(* infinity.  The algorithm repeatedly performs the following action.  It  *)
(* chooses an arbitrary node n that has a neighbor m such that dist[n] >   *)
(* dist[m]+1, and it sets dist[n] to dist[m]+1.                            *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* For simplicity, we assume that we're also given a number MaxCardinality *)
(* that's greater than or equal to the number of nodes, and we use         *)
(* MaxCardinality instead of infinity.  For a reason to be given below, we *)
(* also modify the algorithm as follows.  For a node n with dist[n] >      *)
(* dist[m}+1, instead of setting dist[n] to dist[m]+1 the algorithm sets   *)
(* it to an arbitrary number d such that dist[n] > d >= dist[m} + 1.       *)
