(* CalculateHash constant is the greatest source of trouble. The way this  *)
(* works is by playing fast and loose with TLC's level checker: it will    *)
(* rightfully error out if we instantiate the Nano spec with a variable-   *)

(* constant in this spec then override it with a variable-level function   *)
(* *in the model* then all is well. The specific operator used is the      *)
(* CalculateHashImpl operator defined down below. See discussion here:     *)

(* Unfortunately blockchains by their very nature have super-exponential   *)
