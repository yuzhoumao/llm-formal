Specification of an allocator managing a set of resources:         
- Clients can request sets of resources whenever all their previous
  requests have been satisfied.                                    
- Requests can be partly fulfilled, and resources can be returned  
  even before the full request has been satisfied. However, clients
  only have an obligation to return resources after they have      
  obtained all resources they requested.
