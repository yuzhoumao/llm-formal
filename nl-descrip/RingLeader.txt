A simple distributed lock service with a single lock that passes amongst the hosts. It defines the systemâ€™s state as a history: a sequence of host IDs such that the nth host in the sequence held the lock in epoch n. Initially, this history contains one valid host. The system can step from an old to a new state by appending a valid host to the history. An implementation is consistent with the spec if all lock messages for epoch n come from the nth host in the history.
