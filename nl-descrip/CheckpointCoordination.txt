There are five replicas in a Ring Master cluster, one of which is elected primary at any given time.
The other four replicas are secondaries.
These secondaries must occasionally take a checkpoint of their local state and upload the resulting codex to cloud storage as a backup.
Currently, the secondaries take checkpoints at random.
This means that occasionally multiple secondary replicas take checkpoints simultaneously.
We want to begin performing read operations on secondaries, which is not possible while they are taking a checkpoint.
Thus, we want only one secondary replica to take a checkpoint at any given time.
We furthermore wish for the replicas to rotate evenly through taking a checkpoint.
