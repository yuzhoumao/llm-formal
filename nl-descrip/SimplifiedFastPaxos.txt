FastPaxos protocol with the following simplyfing assumptions:
1. There is a unique coordinator in the system. Therefore, Phase 1a and 1b can be omitted.
2. All agents in the system can communicate with one another.
3. Agents must have some stable storage that survives failure and restarts.
    An agent restores its state from stable storage when it restarts, so the failure of an agent
    is indistinguishable from its simply pausing. There is thus no need to model failures explicitly.
