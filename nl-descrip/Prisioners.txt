The warden of a prison gives his prisoners the following problem.
There is a room in the prison with two switches, labeled A and B.
Each switch can be either up or down.  Every so often, the warden
will select a prisoner at random and take him into the room, where
he must flip (change the position of) exactly one of the switches.
The only guarantee he makes is that every prisoner will eventually
be brought into the room multiple times.  (More precisely, there 
will never be a time after which some prisoner is never again    
brought into the room.)                                          
                                                                 
At any time, any prisoner may declare that all the prisoners have
been in the room at least once.  If that prisoner is right, then 
all the prisoners go free.  If he is wrong, all the prisoners are
immediately executed.                                            
                                                                 
The prisoners are allowed to decide upon a strategy, after which 
they will not be allowed to communicate with one another.  And, of
course, they cannot see the room or who is being brought into it.
What do they do?
